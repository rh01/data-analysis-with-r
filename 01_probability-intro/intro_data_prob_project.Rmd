## Setup
This document is an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the [2013 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)](https://cdc.gov/brfss) data that has been provided to students of the Coursera course, [Introduction to Probability and Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn//supplement/1E7zQ/project-information), taught by Duke University.

The primary objective of the BRFSS is to, “collect uniform, state-specific data on preventive health practices and risk behaviors that are linked to chronic diseases, injuries, and preventable infectious diseases that affect the adult population.”

In this document, I will briefly comment on the data itself (how it was collected and if causality can be inferred), suggest three research questions based on the variables measured in the dataset and lastly perform the exploratory analyses to address the research questions.

We begin by loading necessary R packages and the BRFSS data itself.

### Load packages

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

### Load data



```{r load-data}
load("brfss2013.RData")
```

## Part 1: Data


As noted above, the data analyzed here were obtained from the 2013 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) survey, administered by the Centers for Disease Control’s Population Health Surveillance Branch. The data are based on a population of non-institutionalized adults residing in all 50 states of the USA and its territories, who are at least 18 years old and who have a landline or cellular telephone. Results based on these data are NOT generalizable beyond the aforementioned population from which the samples were obtained, e.g. not to a population under 18 years of age, nor to those living outside of the USA and its territories.

These data were collected by using a disproportionate stratified sampling design followed by simple random sampling of strata in 51 projects, whereas only simple random sampling was employed in Guam and Puerto Rico. Disproportionate stratified sampling was used in order to ensure that enough members of underrepresented groups would be included in the samples. For more details, please see page 6 of the BRFSS overview.

These data comprise an in-depth observational study, without random assignment of subjects into experimental/control groups. Therefore, it is NOT possible to infer causality based on these data.

With any survey, it is important to consider sources of potential bias. One potential bias that should be considered is non-response. For example, perhaps very busy people are underrepresented, or people who work nights and sleep during the day, thus would be absent during the times of the phone calls.

Additionally, there may be an inherent bias between individuals/households who primarily use cell phones instead of landlines, i.e. perhaps people who only use cell phones are younger and more mobile whereas those who maintain landlines spend more time at home. Another potential source of bias could arise from the demeanor of the interviewer conducting the survey over the telephone. If the interviewer’s performance was sub-standard or somehow offputting, this could affect the responsiveness of the participant.

## Part 2: Research questions


**Research quesion 1:**

The first question I have is the following:

Of the 50 states in the U.S.A, which have the highest proportion of college graduates? Or, in other words, is the distribution of college graduates uniform across the USA? The variables of interest here are, education level and state of residence. The question could be considered interesting from the standpoint of subsetting the U.S population by education level and then looking at other indicators of health – moving towards to the hypothesis that having a higher education results in a healthier populace.

**Research quesion 2:**

The second question I have come up with is the following:

How does marital status and employment status correlate with the incidence of having been told that one has major depression? In other words, are retired people more happy than employed people, and does this happiness change depending on if one is married or divorced? The variables of interest here are employment status, marital status and depression status.

**Research quesion 3:**

The final question is the following:

Are those people who have been told they have major depression overweight and is there a difference between the sexes?

The variables of interest here are addepev2, sex and X_bmi5. The underlying hypothesis here is that there will be a difference in body mass index across the sexes and that those who are overweight or obese will tend to be more depressed.
